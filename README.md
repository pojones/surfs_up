# surfs_up
## Overview
This project uses weather observation data collected from multiple stations on Oahu. Specifically, an analysis on the months of June and December is done to compare temperature variations between seasons and the feasibility of a shop reliant on consistent and higher annual temperatures. 
## Results
-	Summary comparison between June and December (Full Island Averages) <br/>

-	June temperature average (by frequency of observation) <br/>

### Some observations worth noting:
-	The difference in temperature averages across the whole island is 3.9 degrees from June to December.
-	The highest temperatures recorded were 85 degress in June and 83 degrees in December.
-	The median is just barely higher than the mean in June, but just lower in December. 
-	The station we selected as an example has a lower mode than the island average for both June and December.
-	The station we selected as an example has a lower max temp than the island average in both June and December.
## Summary
The analysis was done on the station USC00519281 because it displayed the highest number of observations so should have yielded the greatest resolution in the data. The data indicate that the area around this station is generally cooler in June than the island average, but does not share as much variance from the island average in December. This area also does not reflect the warmest temperatures on the island for either month. With that said, since the majority of temperatures for June is lower than the average and December roughly average, there is less variance between the two months. So, while this area isn’t the hottest on the island, it has generally less variance from season to season. This would lead us to believe that business should be steadier throughout the year but perhaps less busy in the summer than if a warmer location were chosen. Ideally, the analysis done for station USC00519281 would be performed for each station until a proper match was found. Some additional information needed to find an appropriate location for; let’s say, an ice-cream-serving surf shop, would be wave and wind data. Indeed, a full analysis would require much more attention.
